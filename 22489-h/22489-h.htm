<h2>IMAGINATION AND
RECOGNITION</h2>


<div class="sidenote"><i>Recognizing
the Past
as Past</i></div>
<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">In the</span> preceding volume of this
<i>Course</i>, entitled &ldquo;The Trained
Memory,&rdquo; you learned that the
memory process involves four
elements, Retention, Recall, Recognition
and Imagination; and the scope
and operation of two of these elements,
Retention and Recall, were explained
to you.</p>

<p>There remain Recognition and Imagination,
which we shall make the
subject of this book. We shall treat of
them, however, not only as parts of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4" href="#Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
memory process, but also as distinct
operations, with an individual significance
and value.</p>

<p>Both Recognition and Imagination
have to do with mental images.</p>

<p>Recognition relates exclusively to
those mental images that are the replica
of former experiences. <i>It is the faculty
of the mind by which we recognize remembered
experiences as a part of our
own past.</i> If it were not for this sense of
familiarity and of ownership and of the
past tense of recalled mental images,
there would be no way for us to distinguish
the sense-perceptions of the
past from those of the present.</p>

<p>Recognition is therefore an element
of vital necessity to every act of
memory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Imagination,
Past,
Present
and Future</i></div>

<p>Imagination relates either to the past,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5" href="#Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the present or the future. On the one
hand, it is the outright re-imagery in
the mind&#8217;s eye of past experiences. On
the other hand, it is the creation of new
and original mental images or visions
by the recombination of old experiential
elements.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6" href="#Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<h2>KINDS OF MENTAL
IMAGES</h2>


<div class="sidenote"><i>Visual
Imagery</i></div>
<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">When</span> we speak of &ldquo;images&rdquo;
in connection
with Imagination and
Recognition we do not
refer merely to mental pictures of
things seen. <i>Mental images are representations
of past mental experiences of
any and every kind.</i> They include past
sensations of sound, taste, smell, feeling,
pain, motion and the other senses, as
well as sensations of sight. One may
have a mental image of the voice of a
friend, of the perfume of a flower, just
as he may have mental images of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" href="#Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
appearance to the eye. Indeed, the term
&ldquo;image&rdquo; is perhaps unfortunately used
in this way, since it must be made to
include not only mental pictures in a
visual sense, but all forms of reproductive
mental activity.</p>

<p>Our recollection of past experiences
may be either full and distinct or hazy
and inadequate. Some persons are entirely
unable to reproduce certain kinds
of sensory experiences. Somehow they
are aware of having had these experiences,
but they cannot reproduce them.
Every one of us has his own peculiarities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Auditory
Imagery</i></div>

<p>This morning I called upon a friend
in his office. I was there but a short
time. Yet I can easily call to mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" href="#Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
every detail of the surroundings. I can
see the exterior of the building, its
form, size, color, window-boxes with
flowers, red tile roof, formal gardens
in the open court, and even many of the
neighboring buildings. I can plainly
recall the color of the carpet on his
office floor, the general tone of the
paper on the wall, the size, type and
material of his desk, and many other
elements going to make up an almost
perfect mental duplicate of the scene
itself. I can even see my friend sitting
at his desk, and can distinctly remember
the color, cut and texture of his
clothing and just how he looked when
he smiled.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Imagery
of Taste
and Smell</i></div>

<p>Last evening we entertained a number
of friends at dinner. One of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" href="#Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
ladies was an accomplished musician,
and later in the evening she delighted
us with her exquisite playing upon the
piano. The airs she played were familiar
to me. I am fond of music and I
enjoyed her playing. I can sit here
today and in imagination I can see her
seated before the piano and remember
just how her hands looked as she fingered
the keys. But I find it difficult to
recall the air of the selection or the
tones of the piano. My mental images
of the notes as they came from the piano
are faint and uncertain and not nearly
so distinct and clear as my recollection
of the scene.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Muscular
and Tactual
Imagery</i></div>

<p>I find it easy to recall the appearance
of the food that was served me for
breakfast this morning. I can also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" href="#Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
faintly imagine the odor and taste of
the coffee and toast, but I find that these
images of taste and smell are not
nearly so realistic as my mental images
of what I saw and heard during the
course of the meal.</p>

<p>When I was in college I was very
fond of handball and was a member of
the handball team. It has been many
years since I played the game, yet I
can distinctly feel the peculiar tension
of the right arm and shoulder muscles
that accompanied the &ldquo;service.&rdquo; Nor
do I feel the slightest difficulty in evoking
a distinct mental image of the
prickly sensations that so annoyed me
as a boy when I would first put on
woolen underwear in the fall of the
year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Personal
Differences
in Mental
Imagery</i></div>

<p>From these examples, it is apparent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" href="#Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
that we can form mental images of past
sensations of sight, sound, taste, smell
and feeling, and indeed of every kind,
including the muscular or motor sense
and the sense of heat and cold.</p>

<p>But there is the greatest possible difference
in individuals in this respect.
Some persons have distinct images of
things they have seen, are good visualizers.
Others are weak in this respect,
but have clear auditory images. And so
as to all the various kinds of sensory
images.</p>

<p>This is a fact of comparatively recent
discovery. The first proponent of the
idea was Fechner, but no statistical
work was done in this line until Galton
entered the field, in 1880. In his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" href="#Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
&ldquo;Inquiries into Human Faculties,&rdquo; he
says:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Investigations
of Doctor
Galton</i></div>

<p>&ldquo;To my astonishment, I found that
the great majority of the men of science
to whom I first applied protested that
mental imagery was unknown to them,
and they looked on me as fanciful and
fantastic in supposing that the words
&lsquo;mental imagery&rsquo; really expressed what
I believed everybody supposed them to
mean. They had no more notion of its
true nature than a color-blind man, who
has not discerned his defect, has of the
nature of color. They had a mental deficiency
of which they were unaware
and naturally enough supposed that
those who affirmed they possessed it
were romancing.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Investigations
of Professor
James</i></div>

<p>The investigations of Dr. Galton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" href="#Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
were continued by Professor James, of
Harvard University. He collected from
hundreds of persons descriptions of
their own mental images. The following
are extracts from two cases of distinctly
different types. The one who is
a good visualizer says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning&#8217;s breakfast-table is
both dim and bright; it is dim if I try
to think of it with my eyes closed. All
the objects are clear at once, yet when
I confine my attention to any one object
it becomes far more distinct. I have
more power to recall color than any
other one thing; if, for example, I were
to recall a plate decorated with flowers
I could reproduce in a drawing the
exact tone, etc. The color of anything
that was on the table is perfectly vivid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" href="#Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
There is very little limitation to the extent
of my images; I can see all four
sides of a room; I can see all four
sides of two, three, four, even more
rooms with such distinctness that if you
should ask me what was in any particular
place in any one, or ask me to count
the chairs, etc., I could do it without
the least hesitation. The more I learn
by heart the more clearly do I see
images of my pages. Even before I can
recite the lines I see them so that I
could give them very slowly word for
word, but my mind is so occupied in
looking at my printed image that I
have no idea of what I am saying, of
the sense of it, etc. When I first found
myself doing this I used to think it
was merely because I knew the lines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" href="#Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
imperfectly; but I have quite convinced
myself that I really do see an
image. The strongest proof that such
is really the fact is, I think, the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can look down the mentally seen
page and see the words that commence
all the lines, and from any one of these
words I can continue the line. I find
this much easier to do if the words begin
as in a straight line than if there are
breaks. Example:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Etant fait<br />
Tous .............<br />
A des ............<br />
Que fit ..........<br />
Ceres ............<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Avec ...........</span><br />
Un fleur .........<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comme ..........</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(La Fontaine S. IV.)&rdquo;</span><br />

<p>The poor visualizer says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" href="#Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My ability to form mental images
seems, from what I have studied of
other people&#8217;s images, to be defective,
and somewhat peculiar. The process by
which I seem to remember any particular
event is not by a series of distinct
images, but a sort of panorama, the
faintest impressions of which are perceptible
through a thick fog&mdash;I cannot
shut my eyes and get a distinct
image of anyone, although I used to be
able to a few years ago, and the faculty
seems to have gradually slipped away.
* * * In my most vivid dreams, where
the events appear like the most real
facts, I am often troubled with a dimness
of sight which causes the images to
appear indistinct. * * * To come to the
question of the breakfast-table, there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" href="#Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
nothing definite about it. Everything
is vague. I cannot say what I see. I
could not possibly count the chairs, but
I happen to know that there are ten. I
see nothing in detail. * * * The chief
thing is a general impression that I cannot
tell exactly what I do see. The
coloring is about the same, as far as I
can recall it, only very much washed
out. Perhaps the only color I can see
at all distinctly is that of the tablecloth,
and I could probably see the color of
the wall paper if I could remember
what color it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This difference between individuals
is just as marked in the matter of ability
to form <i>auditory</i> images as in respect to
<i>visual</i> images.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Investigations
of Professor
Scott</i></div>

<p>Thus, Professor Walter Dill Scott,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" href="#Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of Northwestern University, cites the
following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;One student who has strong auditory
imagery writes as follows: &lsquo;When
I think of the breakfast-table I do not
seem to have a clear visual image of it.
I can see the length of it, the three
chairs&mdash;though I can&#8217;t tell the color
or shape of these&mdash;the white cloth and
something on it, but I can&#8217;t see the pattern
of the dishes or any of the food.
I can very plainly hear the rattle of the
dishes and of the silver and above this
hear the conversation, also the other
noises, such as a train which passes
every morning while we are at breakfast.
Again, in a football game I distinctly
hear the noise, but do not see
clearly anything <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" href="#Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>or anybody. I hear the
stillness when everyone is intent and
then the loud cheering. Here I notice
the differences of pitch and tone.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had read that some people were
unable to imagine sounds which they
had heard, but it had not impressed me,
for I had supposed that such persons
were great exceptions. I was truly surprised
when I found so many of my
students writing papers similar to those
from which extracts are here given:
&lsquo;My mental imagery is visual, as I seem
to see things and not hear, feel or smell
them. The element of sound seems
practically never to enter in. When I
think of a breakfast-table or a football
game I have a distinct image. I see
colors, but hear no sound.&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" href="#Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Another in describing his image of
a railroad-train, writes: &lsquo;I am not able
to state whether I hear the train or not.
I am inclined to think that it is a noiseless
one. It is hard for me to conceive
of the sound of a bell, for instance. I
can see the bell move to and fro, and
for an instant seem to hear the ding,
dong; but it is gone before I can identify
it. When I try to conceive of shouts
I am like one groping in the dark. I
cannot possibly retain the conception
of a sound for any length of time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another, who seems to have no
vivid images of any kind, writes:
&lsquo;When I recall the breakfast-table I see
it and the persons around it. The number
of them is distinct, for there is only
one of them on each side of the table.
But they seem like mere objects in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" href="#Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
space. Only when I think of each
separately do I clearly see them. As
for the table, all I see is a general
whiteness, interspersed with objects. I
hear nothing at all, and indeed the
whole thing is so indistinct it bewilders
me when I think of it. My mental
imagery is very vague and hazy, unless
I have previously taken special notice
of what I now have an image of. For
instance, when I have an image of a
certain person I cannot tell his particular
characteristics unless my attention
was formerly directed to them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another writes: &lsquo;There is no sound
in connection with any image. In remembering,
I call up an incident and
gradually fill out the details. I can very
seldom recall how anything sounds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" href="#Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
One sound from the play &ldquo;Robespierre,&rdquo;
by Henry Irving, which I
heard about two years ago and which
I could recall some time afterward, I
have been unable to recall this fall,
though I have tried to do so. I can see
the scene quite perfectly, the position
of the actors and stage setting, even the
action of a player who brought out the
sound.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite a large proportion of persons
find it impossible to imagine motion at
all. As they think of a football game,
all the players are standing stock-still;
they are as they are represented in a
photograph. They are in the act of
running, but no motion is represented.
Likewise, the banners and streamers are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" href="#Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
all motionless. They find it impossible
to think of such a thing as motion.
Others find that the motions are the
most vivid part of their images. What
they remember of a scene is principally
movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One writes: &lsquo;When the word
&ldquo;breakfast-table&rdquo; was given out I saw
our breakfast-table at home, especially
the table and the white tablecloth. The
cloth seemed to be the most distinct
object. I can see each one in his place at
the table. I can see no color except that
of the tablecloth. The dishes are there,
but are very indistinct. I cannot hear
the rattle of the dishes or the voices
very distinctly; the voices seem much
louder than the dishes, but neither are
very clear. I can feel the motions which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" href="#Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
I make during the breakfast hour. I
feel myself come in, sit down and begin
to eat. I can see the motions of those
about me quite plainly. I believe the
feeling of motion was the most distinct
feeling I had. When the word &ldquo;railroad-train&rdquo;
was given I saw the train
very plainly just stopping in front of
the depot. I saw the people getting on
the train; these people were very indistinct.
It is their motions rather than
the people themselves which I see. I
can feel myself getting on the train,
finding a seat, and sitting down. I cannot
hear the noise of the train, but can
hear rather indistinctly the conductor
calling the stations. I believe my mental
imagery is more motile (of movement)
than anything else. Although I
can see some things quite plainly, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" href="#Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
seem to feel the movements most distinctly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very few in describing their
images of the breakfast-table made
special mention of the taste of the food
and of its odor. I have discovered no
one whose prevailing imagery is for
either taste or smell. With very many
the image of touch is very vivid. They
can imagine just how velvet feels, how
a fly feels on one&#8217;s nose, the discomfort
of a tight shoe, and the pleasure of
stroking a smooth marble surface.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>HOW TO INFLUENCE
OTHERS THROUGH MENTAL
IMAGERY</h2>


<div class="sidenote"><i>A Rule
for
Influencing
Others</i></div>
<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> practical importance of
the fact of mental imagery
and of the individual differences
in power of mental
imagery is very great. They should
be particularly taken into account in
any business or profession in which one
seeks to implant knowledge or conviction
in the mind of another.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Application
to Pedagogy</i></div>

<p>The underlying principle in such
cases is this: <i>To the mind you are seeking
to convince or educate, present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" href="#Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
your facts in as many different ways
and as realistically as possible, so that
there may be a variety of images, each
serving as a clue to prompt the memory.</i></p>

<p>We cannot do more at this point than
indicate a few minor phases of the practical
application of the principles of
mental imagery.</p>

<p>In the old days geography was taught
simply with a book and maps. Today
children also use their hands in molding
relief maps in sand or clay, and
mountains and rivers have acquired a
meaning they never had before.</p>

<p>In the days of the oral &ldquo;spelling
match&rdquo; boys and girls were better
spellers than products of a later school
system, because they used not only the
eye to see the printed word, the arm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" href="#Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and hand to feel in writing it, but also
the ear to hear it and the vocal muscles
to utter it. And because of this fact
oral spelling is being brought back to
the schoolroom.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How to
Sell Goods
by Mental
Imagery</i></div>

<p>If you have pianos to advertise, do
not limit your advertisement to a
beautiful picture of the mahogany case
and general words telling the reader
that it is &ldquo;the best.&rdquo; Pianos are musical
instruments, and the descriptive words
should first of all call up delightful
<i>auditory images</i> in your reader&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>If you have for sale an article of
food, do not simply tell your customer
how good it is. Let him see it, feel it,
and particularly <i>taste it</i>, if you want
him to call for it the next time he enters
your store.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Study
of
Advertisements</i></div>

<p>Turn, for example, to the <a href="#ad">advertisement</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" href="#Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of a certain brand of chocolate,
facing <a href="#Page_6">page&nbsp;6</a>. The daintily spread
table, the pretty girl, the steaming cup,
the evident satisfaction of the man, who
looks accustomed to good living,&mdash;these
elements combine in a skilful appeal to
the senses. Turn now to <a href="#ad2">another&nbsp;advertisement</a>
of this same brand of chocolate,
shown facing <a href="#Page_22">page&nbsp;22</a>. The purpose
here is to inform you as to the large
quantity of cocoa beans roasted in the
company&#8217;s furnaces. Whether this fact
is of any consequence or not, the impression
you get from the picture is of
a wheelbarrow full of something that
looks like coal being trundled by a dirty
workman, while the shovel by the furnace
door and the cocoa beans scattered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" href="#Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
about the floor remind one of a begrimed
iron foundry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Words
that Create
Desire</i></div>

<p><i>The only words that will ever sell
anything are graphic words, picturesque
words, words that call up distinct and
definite mental pictures of an attractive
kind.</i></p>

<p>The more sensory images we have of
any object the better we know it.</p>

<p><i>If you want to make a first impression
lasting, make it vivid. It will then
photograph itself upon the memory and
arouse the curiosity.</i></p>

<p>A boy who is a poor visualizer will
never make a good artist. A man who
is a poor visualizer is out of place as a
photographer or a picture salesman.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Key for
Selecting
a Calling</i></div>

<p>No person with weak auditory images
should follow music as a profession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" href="#Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
or attempt to sell phonographs or musical
instruments or become a telephone
or telegraph operator or stenographer.</p>

<p>No man who can but faintly imagine
the taste of things should try to write
advertisements for articles of food.</p>

<p>Remember the rule: <i>To the mind
you are seeking to convince or educate
present your facts in as many different
ways and as realistically as possible, so
that there may be a variety of images,
each serving as a clue to prompt the
memory.</i></p>

<p>You can put this rule to practical use
at once. Try it. You will be delighted
with the result.</p>

<p>2. How clearly can you see the space<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41" href="#Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
that intervenes between your house and
some far-distant object? Have you a
clear impression of the visual elements
that determine this distance?</p>

<p>3. Can you see a bird flying through
the air? an automobile rushing down
the street?</p>

<p>4. Can you imagine a red surface?
a green surface? Try each primary
color; which is most distinct to your
mind&#8217;s eye?</p>

<p>5. Can you see a smooth surface? a
rough surface? a curved surface? a flat

<h2>THE
CREATIVE IMAGINATION</h2>


<div class="sidenote"><i>The Process
of Creative
Imagination</i></div>
<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> is another type of imagination
from the purely
reproductive memory imagination
of which we
have been speaking in this book.</p>

<p>There is also Creative Imagination.</p>

<p>Creative Imagination is more than
mere memory. It takes the elements of
the past as reproduced by memory and
rearranges them. It forms new combinations
out of the material of the past.
It forms new combinations of ideas,
emotions and their accompanying im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" href="#Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>pulses
to muscular activity, the elements
of mental &ldquo;complexes.&rdquo; It recombines
these elements into new and original
mental pictures, the creations of the
inventive mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Business
and Financial
Imagination</i></div>

<p>No particular profession or pursuit
has a monopoly of creative imagination.
It is not the exclusive property of the
poet, the artist, the inventor, the philosopher.
We tell you this because you
have heard all your life of the poetic
imagination, the artistic imagination,
and so on, but it is rare indeed that you
have heard mention of the business
imagination.</p>

<p>The fact is no man can succeed in any
pursuit unless he has a creative imagination.
Without creative imagination
the human race would still be living in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51" href="#Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
caves. Without creative imagination
there would be no ships, no engines, no
automobiles, no corporations, no systems,
no plans, no business. Nothing
exists in all the world that had not a
previous counterpart in the mind of
him who designed it. And back of all is
the creative mind of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How
Wealth
is Created</i></div>

<p>Mind is supreme. Mind shapes and
controls matter. Every concrete thing
in the world is the product of a thinking
consciousness. The richly tinted
canvas is the physical expression of the
artist&#8217;s dream. The great factory, with
its whirling mechanisms and glowing
furnaces, is the material manifestation
of the promoter&#8217;s financial imagination.
The jeweled ornament, the book, the
steamship, the office building, all are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" href="#Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
but concrete realizations of human
thought molded out of formless matter.</p>

<p>Mind, finite and infinite, is eternally
creative and creating in the organization
of formless matter and material
forces into concrete realities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Klamath
Philosophy</i></div>

<p>Says Max M&uuml;ller in his &ldquo;Psychological
Religion&rdquo;: &ldquo;The Klamaths,
one of the Red Indian tribes, believe in
a Supreme God whom they call &lsquo;The
Most Ancient One,&rsquo; &lsquo;Our Old Father,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;The Old One on High.&rsquo; He is believed
to have created the world&mdash;that
is, to have made plants, animals and
man. But when asked how the Old
Father created the world, the Klamath
philosopher replies: <i>&lsquo;By thinking and
willing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</i></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How
Men
Get Things</i></div>

<p>We get what we desire because the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" href="#Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
things we desire are the things we think
about. Love begets love. The man who
is looking for trouble generally finds
it. Despair is the forerunner of disaster,
and fear brings failure, because
despair and fear are the emotional
elements attendant upon thoughts of
defeat.</p>

<p>Behind every thing and every act is,
and always has been, thought&mdash;thought
of sufficient intensity to shape and
fashion the physical event.</p>

<p>Mind, and mind alone, possesses the
inscrutable power to create.</p>

<p>Your career is ordered by the
thoughts you entertain. Mental pictures
tend to accomplish their own realization.
Therefore, be careful to hold
only those thoughts that will build up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" href="#Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
rather than tear down the structure of
your fortunes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Prerequisites
to
Achievement</i></div>

<p>Creative imagination is an absolute
prerequisite to material achievement.</p>

<p>The business man must scheme and
plan and devise and foresee. He must
create in imagination today the results
that he is to achieve tomorrow. He
must combine the elements of his past
experiential complexes into a mental
picture of future events as he would
have them. Riches are but the material
realization of a financial imagination.
The wealth of the world is but the sum
total of the contributions of the creative
thoughts of the successful men of all
ages.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How

<p>With these principles before you,
you can plainly see that the <i>creative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" href="#Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
imagination must be called upon in the

are seeking to improve some particular
department of your business.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How
to Take
Radical Steps
in Business</i></div>

<p>In the determination of how best you
can better yourself, either in your present
field of action or by the selection of
a new one, take the following steps:
(1) Pass in review before the mind&#8217;s
eye your present situation; (2) Your
possible ways of betterment; (3) The
various circumstances and individuals
that will aid in this or that line of self-advancement;
(4) The difficulties that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" href="#Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
may confront you. Having selected
your field, (5) Consider various possible
plans of action; (6) Have prevision
of their working out; (7) Compare
the ultimate results as you foresee
them; (8) Decide upon the one most
promising, and then with this plan as
a foundation for further imaginings,
(9) Once more call before you the
elements that will contribute to success;
(10) See the possible locations
for your new place of business and
choose among them; (11) Outline in
detail the methods to be pursued in
getting and handling business; (12)
See the different kinds of employees
and associates you will require, and
select certain classes as best suited to
your needs; (13) Foresee possible dif<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" href="#Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>ficulties
to be encountered and adjust
your plans to meet them; and, most
important of all, (14) Have a clear
and persistent vision of yourself as a
man of action, setting to work upon
your plan at a fixed hour and carrying
it to a successful issue within a given
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Expansion
of Business
Ideals</i></div>

<p>There is excellent practical psychology
in the following from &ldquo;Thoughts
on Business&rdquo;:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men often think of a position as
being just about so big and no bigger,
when, as a matter of fact, a position is
often what one makes it. A man was
making about $1,500 a year out of a
certain position and thought he was
doing all that could be done to advance
the business. The employer thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" href="#Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
otherwise, and gave the place to another
man who soon made the position worth
$8,000 a year&mdash;at exactly the same
commission.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rising
to the
Emergency</i></div>

<p>&ldquo;The difference was in the men&mdash;in
other words, in what the two men
thought about the work. One had a
little conception of what the work
should be, and the other had a big
conception of it. One thought little
thoughts, and the other thought big
thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The standards of two men may differ,
not especially because one is naturally
more capable than the other, but
because one is familiar with big things
and the other is not. The time was when
the former worked in a smaller scope
himself, but when he saw a wider view<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" href="#Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
of what his work might be he rose to
the occasion and became a bigger man.
It is just as easy to think of a mountain
as to think of a hill&mdash;when you turn
your mind to contemplate it. The mind
is like a rubber band&mdash;you can stretch
it to fit almost anything, but it draws in
to a small scope when you let go.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Constructive
Imagination</i></div>

<p>&ldquo;Make it your business to know what
is the best that might be in your line of
work, and stretch your mind to conceive
it, and then devise some way to
attain it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Little Tasks
and
Big Tasks</i></div>

<p>&ldquo;Big things are only little things put
together. I was greatly impressed with
this fact one morning as I stood watching
the workmen erecting the steel
framework for a tall office building.
A shrill whistle rang out as a signal, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" href="#Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
man over at the engine pulled a lever,
a chain from the derrick was lowered,
and the whistle rang out again. A man
stooped down and fastened the chain
around the center of a steel beam,
stepped back and blew the whistle once
more. Again the lever was moved at
the engine, and the steel beam soared
into the air up to the sixteenth story,
where it was made fast by little bolts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The entire structure, great as it was,
towering far above all the neighboring
buildings, was made up of pieces of
steel and stone and wood, put together
according to a plan. The plan was first
imagined, then penciled, then carefully
drawn, and then followed by the workmen.
It was all a combination of little
things.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Working Up
a Department</i></div>

<p>&ldquo;It is encouraging to think of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" href="#Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
when you are confronted by a big task.
Remember that it is only a group of
little tasks, any of which you can easily
do. It is ignorance of this fact that
makes some men afraid to try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suppose, now, that instead of making
a radical change in your business situation,
you are simply seeking to improve
some particular department of your
business.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Imagination
in Handling
Employees</i></div>

<p>In commercial affairs men are the
great means to money-making, and
efficient personal service the great key
to prosperity. In your dealings with
employees do not be guided by the
necessities of the moment. Expediency
is the poorest of all excuses for action.
Have regard not only for your own im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" href="#Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>mediate
needs, but also for the welfare
and future conduct of your employees.
It is part of the burden of the executive
head that he must do the forethinking
not only for himself but for those under
him.</p>

<p>Perhaps the man you have under
observation for advancement to some
executive position has all the basic
qualifications of judicial sense, discrimination
and attentiveness to details,
but you are uncertain whether he has
enough imagination to devise new ways
and means of doing things and developing
business in new fields. If you wish
to try a simple but very effective test
along this line, you can adopt the following
standard psychological experiment,
which has been used at Harvard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" href="#Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Cornell and many other colleges and
schools.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How to
Test an
Employee&#8217;s
Imagination</i></div>

<p>Let fall a drop of ink on each of
several pieces of white paper, letterhead
size. This will make irregular
blotches of varying forms. Let the subject
be seated at a desk and ask him to
write briefly about what he sees in each
blotched sheet, whether it be an animal
form suggested by the outline of the
blot, or anything else that comes into
his mind while looking at the black
spot. The principle involved here is
the same as that involved in seeing pictures
in a flickering log fire or having
a vision of past or future events by gazing
into a crystal. In any of these cases,
it is not the blot, the fire or the crystal
that produces the vision, but the cre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" href="#Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>ative
imagination that recombines old
elements into new forms. The number
of images suggested to one by certain
standard forms of ink-blot when compared
with established results is a
measure of his imaginative ability.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Imagination
in Business
Generally</i></div>

<p>In the choice of a location for your
factory or store, you must foresee its
future traffic and transportation possibilities.
In passing upon a proposed
advertisement you must get inside the
head of the man on the street and see it
as he will see it. In the purchase of
your stock of goods you must gauge the
trend of popular taste and foresee the
big demand. In your dealings with
creditors you must plan a course of
action that will enable you to settle the
account to <i>your</i> best interest at <i>their</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" href="#Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
request. You must find a way to collect
from your debtors and at the same
time hold their business. And so in a
hundred thousand different ways you
are constantly required to use creative
thought in laying every stone in the
structure of your fortune.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Imagination
and Action</i></div>

<p>Do not understand us as saying that
imagination, as the term is popularly
used, is all you need. There must be
also action, incessant, persistent. But
<i>creative imagination, in a psychological
and scientific sense, begets action.
Every thought carries with it the impellent
energy to effect its realization.</i>
Use your imagination in your business
and the action will take care of itself.
Given imagination and action, and you
are sure to win.</p>
